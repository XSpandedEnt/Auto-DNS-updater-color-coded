### 🚀 Features

* 🎨 **IPvTri+ Color-Coded DNS System**
  Each DNS server uses RGB + Lightness values embedded in its IP structure, making traffic traceable, semantically rich, and human/A.I. friendly.

* 🧠 **Smart Auto-Switching**
  Continuously monitors your DNS pool and switches to the fastest available server using PowerShell A-record lookups.

* 🛡️ **ICMP Fallback Mode**
  If DNS queries fail, it reverts to ping-based timing to ensure connectivity.

* 🔎 **Auto Interface Detection**
  No config needed — it auto-selects your active network adapter.

* 🧼 **DNS Flush & Reset Logic**
  Clears stale entries after switching to maintain clean, fast resolution.

* 🖥️ **Visual CLI Output**
  Shows live color tags (based on IPvTri+) in the terminal so you can *see* which server is active.
